Initial thoughts on problem statement, making few points will change accordingly:

1. I will be creating a class name recently played songs, and it will have constructor which initialize the 
class variables.
2. In this class I will be creating methods 
   1. To add songs to particular user 
   2. To get recently played songs of particular user, which returns the list of songs of that user.
3. I will be using hashMap, linkedList, ArrayList
4. To eliminate the recently played songs the best data structure to use I think would be linked list. I will be using few methods removeFirst() and addLast() as per problem statement
